  abstract = {Unemployment in Great Britain rose again in the early 1990s. By contrast with previous experience, parts of southern England appeared to suffer earlier and more severely than some other parts of Britain. This reversal of traditional norms fuelled renewed interest in the impact of recession at the local and regional scale. Unemployment dynamics are examined over the period from June 1978 to December 1991 at the local labour market area scale. An analysis of turning points in local unemployment series confirms key differences in the timing of entry into the two recessions experienced during this period. Cluster analysis classification techniques are used to identify the shapes of typical local unemployment cycles and these typical unemployment cycles are shown to display distinctive spatial expressions.},

These studies typically identify multiple factors that are behind the emergence of large and successful firms in particular national clusters. However, there has been relatively little research identifying whether such factors are all collectively necessary to produce the outcome, or whether only a few of the factors in different combinations might be sufficient to generate the shift in competitive advantage manifested in the market power of large “flagship” firms. In this paper, we study the evolution of one industry across six countries in which the competitive position of national firms changed considerably during our 100-year analysis period. The results of our combined historical and fuzzy-set analyses show that an unequal distribution of resources may lead to alternative causal pathways to competitive advantage of the largest firms.},

  doi = {10.1080/00420989420080011},
  abstract = {This paper examines the distribution of, and changes in, house prices in   Australian cities during the 1980s, a period of considerable change in   asset prices in general. The analysis is concerned to document the   marked spatial variability of price movements and to relate these to   processes of urban restructuring. Spatial variability is apparent at two   scales: at the intermetropolitan level as evidenced in trends across the   major capital cities; and at the intra-metropolitan scale where   differences between localities within one city, Melbourne, are   identifiable. Substantial spatial differentials in both the level and in   the rate of change over time of housing prices, have both efficiency and   equity implications. Large regional price variations inhibit mobility   and labour market adjustments; variations in the rate of increase both   redistribute income and wealth in the form of capital gains, and   differentially affect affordability levels. Analysis of different scales   of price movement highlight the fact that some causal factors are common   to all scales and some are scale dependent. At both scales, the most   substantial rises and subsequent falls have been experienced in areas   which have undergone of spatial restructuring consequent on a   concentration of the effects of social and economic transformations.   Changes in demand through long-term economic and social restructuring,   however, were overwhelmed in the tate 1980s by the deregulation of the   financial system, which resulted in a greatly increased flow of finance   into the housing sector. Despite high interest rates, a widespread   belief that continued inflation would both raise the price of the   commodity and reduce the real costs of borrowing, prompted a sharp but   locationally specific rate of housing price increase followed by a slump   in prices where the rises had been most extreme. The recession has   increasingly affected all levels of the market and investment in housing   generally is now being viewed much more cautiously.},

An increased reaction by quantities to disequilibria between supply and demand, on the part of firms, jeopardizes stability. It is demonstrated empirically that the variations of the profit rate influence this degree of reaction and, therefore, impact on stability.},

Text from vid:
Inflation is defined as an overall increase in the price level. Or, in other words, an overall decrease in the purchasing power of the dollar.
When inflation occurs, currency buys fewer goods and services.

The most effective tool used to gauge the level of inflation is the Consumer Price Index, or CPI.
The Consumer Price Index is a basket of about 400 commonly purchased goods and services that is used to represent overall consumption.
Each month, the Department of Labor checks the prices of these 400 different items in 85 areas all over the U.S.
Inflation exists when the average cost of the items is rising. If the average cost of these items remains the same, there is no inflation, even though most likely the prices went up on some of the items, while the prices went down on others.
The overall percentage of increase or decrease of cost for these items from year to year is the annual inflation rate.
Well cover the Consumer Price Index in greater detail in a later video.

There are two types of inflation: demand-pull inflation and cost-push inflation.
Demand-pull inflation occurs when the demand for goods and services increases faster than the supply of goods and services. This increase in demand could come from increases in the money supply, or increases in the amount of money government spends.
Demand-pull inflation is sometimes described as too much money chasing too few goods.
When demand increases, there would be a shortage of many items if prices stayed at the same level. However, prices will not stay at the same level.
When theres a shortage of something, the price on that item will rise until it hits an equilibrium. This causes a rise in the overall average of prices.

Cost-push inflation happens when there is an increase in the cost to produce goods and services. These increased production costs could be increases in the cost of raw materials, energy, or any other item used in production.
There also could be increases in wages. This is sometimes referred to as wage-push inflation, or the price-wage spiral.

The government attempts to combat inflation using fiscal policy and monetary policy.
Fiscal policy is the use of the governments taxing and spending powers to attempt to accomplish economic pulls. Fiscal policy can be used to decrease spending to reduce demand-pull inflation. 
Government can reduce total spending by reducing its own spending. It could also reduce overall spending by raising taxes, which leaves consumers with less money to spend on goods and services.

Monetary policy involves the changing of interest rates and availability of loans to attempt to accomplish economic goals.
The Fed can reduce spending by raising interest rates and making loans harder to obtain, which in turn reduces demand-pull inflation.

Inflation can never be totally eliminated. Furthermore, efforts to reduce inflation tends to cause unemployment, just like efforts to reduce unemployment tends to cause inflation.
Because of this tradeoff, policymakers have to struggle with which is worse when making policy decisions.
Should they attempt to reduce inflation at the cost of higher unemployment? Should they attempt to reduce unemployment at the cost of higher inflation?
These questions are the subject of much debate among economists. And while these policies might work good in theory, its safe to argue that theyre not as effective as one might hope.

There are some other terms worth mentioning briefly. The first is deflation.
Deflation is defined as the general drop in the price level. Or, to put it another way, an increase in the purchasing power of the dollar.
Deflation occurs during recessions when the GDP is declining.
Because of the decline in demand, sellers must reduce their prices to attract buyers, which causes an overall price decrease, also known as deflation.

Geographical studies of innovation typically examine the impact of regional institutions on new product and process development. This study considers the influence of these institutional systems on business strategy and firm-level responses to competitive challenges. The paper examines case of Toronto's life science complex and the growing prevalence of a business strategy of hybridization. Toronto's hybrid firms combine core strengths in biotechnology and biomedical technologies with service activities like contract research and manufacturing, blood bank and data management, and device repair and distribution. This strategy is often viewed as a response to lengthy product development cycles, impatient financiers, and the pressure to identify secondary sources of revenue. However, this explanation overlooks an equally compelling rationale stemming from the larger institutional context that shapes and constrains their strategic choices.

Comme d'habitude, les études géographiques sur l'innovation examinent l'impact des instances régionales sur le développement des nouveaux produits et des nouveaux procédés. La présente étude considère l'influence de ces systèmes institutionnels sur la stratégie commerciale et les réponses aux défis compétitifs sur le plan des entreprises. On considère comme étude de cas le center des sciences de la vie à Toronto et la fréquence croissante d'une stratégie commerciale de d'hybridation. Les entreprises situées à Toronto combinent les principales forces de la biotechnologie et des technologies biomédicales avec des services, tels la recherche ou la production industrielle contractuelles, la gestion des banques du sang et des données, et la réparation et la distribution des dispositifs. Souvent une telle stratégie est considérée une réponse aux cycles de développement longs des produits, aux financiers impatients, et à la nécessité d'identifier des sources de revenu secondaires. Cependant, cette explication ne considère pas une raison d'être tout aussi convaincante qui provient du contexte institutionnel plus large qui détermine et contraint les choix stratégiques.

In den geografischen Studien über Innovation wird in der Regel die Auswirkung regionaler Institutionen auf die Entwicklung von neuen Produkten und Verfahren untersucht. In dieser Studie untersuchen wir, wie diese institutionellen Systeme die Geschäftsstrategie und die Reaktionen von Firmen auf Herausforderungen der Konkurrenz beeinflussen. Untersucht werden der Fall des Life-Science-Komplexes in Toronto und die wachsende Prävalenz einer Geschäftsstrategie der Hybridisierung. Die hybriden Firmen in Toronto kombinieren zentrale Stärken in den Bereichen der Biotechnologie und der biomedizinischen Technologien mit Dienstleistungen wie Auftragsforschung und -produktion, Blutbank- und Datenverwaltung sowie mit der Reparatur und dem Vertrieb von Geräten. Diese Strategie wird oft als Antwort auf langwierige Produktentwicklungszyklen, ungeduldige Geldgeber und den Druck zur Erschließung zusätzlicher Einkommensquellen betrachtet. In dieser Erklärung wird jedoch ein ebenso überzeugender Grund übersehen, der sich aus dem größeren institutionellen Kontext ableitet, welcher die strategischen Entscheidungen dieser Firmen prägt und begrenzt.

Las empresas híbridas en Toronto combinan las ventajas centrales en biotecnología y las tecnologías biomédicas con las actividades de servicios tales como la investigación y manufacturación contratadas, gestión de bancos de sangre y de datos, y la reparación y distribución de dispositivos.

  abstract = {The 11 Recommendations of the UK Stem Cell Initiative
Recommendation 1: The UK Government should establish a public-private partnership to
develop predictive toxicology tools from stem cell lines.
Recommendation 2: The UK Stem Cell Bank should be consolidated in new permanent
facilities adjacent to its current site and its operational and development costs should be
secured for the next decade.
Recommendation 3: The Research Councils should monitor the emergence of Centres of
Excellence in stem cell research, designate them as such and strengthen them with core
funding.
Recommendation 4: Research Councils and private sector funding bodies should support
the development of stem cell therapy production units at UK Centres of Excellence in stem
cell research.
Recommendation 5: The Government and Research Councils should strengthen the levels of
funding for basic stem cell research over the next decade.
Recommendation 6: The Government should provide funding for clinical and translational
stem cell research over the next decade at a level matching that raised by the UK Stem Cell
Foundation (UKSCF), up to a maximum of £10M per annum, and administer it via a UKSCF/
Medical Research Council collaboration.
Recommendation 7: The Department of Health must ensure that the promised increase in
R\&D resources is forthcoming and furthermore, that the full NHS costs of stem cell clinical
research trials within the NHS are supported with extra funding from each Spending Review
over the next decade to match the increase in research grants and activity.
Recommendation 8: The Government should continue to ensure that regulation of stem
cell research is risk-based and proportionate and does not stifl e the development of the full
range of safe and effective new cell therapies for the benefi t of patients. In particular, (i) the
Department of Health should establish a specialised research ethics committee for stem cell
clinical research; (ii) the Government should clarify the regulatory requirements for the use of
animals and animal cells in human stem cell research; \& (iii) for the in vitro use of embryonic
stem cell lines, researchers should be registered with, and submit an annual research
summary report to, the UK Stem Cell Bank.
Recommendation 9: The UK Clinical Research Collaboration should help to (i) coordinate
organisations supporting stem cell research, including all of the relevant Research Councils
and the UK Stem Cell Foundation and (ii) ensure that the National Health Service is optimally
engaged in this area.
Recommendation 10: The Government should allocate additional funding to establish The
UK Stem Cell Cooperative, to maximise the cross-fertilisation between those involved in the
sub-disciplines of UK stem cell research.
Recommendation 11: The Research Councils, charitable funding bodies, and Government
Departments should develop a sustained and coordinated programme of public dialogue
on stem cell research over the next decade.},

An empirical analysis of the UK state's governance of economic development within England reveals the construction of enabling frameworks at the national level and, in the wake of regionalization and regionalism, the encouragement of new  spatial imaginaries' (cities and/or city-regions, localisms and pan-regionalisms). The result has been complexity, experimentation, fragmentation and incoherence with largely negative implications for territorial equity and justice. We conclude by reflecting upon the limits of projects of state decentralization and spatial policy under a strong national economic growth orientation in addressing the governance of uneven development.},

We examined the sources of relative per capita income growth using an augmented growth model and a panel of the 48 contiguous states from 1939 to 2004. We explored the effect of tax burdens, public infrastructure, size of private financial markets, rates of business failure, industry structure, climate, educational attainment, and technology production. Our results show that a state's technology and its college attainment rates are the main factors that allow some state's per capita income to remain above those of other states.},

  abstract = {This paper develops a two-period overlapping generations model with heterogeneous agents aiming at analysing how decentralization in the provision of public education affects growth and personal inequality via human capital investment. Education is financed by a tax levied by either national or local authorities. The tax rate is chosen according to a median voter mechanism. During their working period of life, individuals look after their offspring by providing them with a high level of school education stemming from taxation. In addition parent's contributions to the social security system provide them with retirement income. Heterogeneity accounts for the differences in the optimal taxation mechanism, linking the income distribution to the tax rate, and hence to human capital accumulation, growth and income inequality. In this way we relate differences among agents to the tax rate. We show that decentralization induces growth rate disparities among local communities but it can be ruled out by a proper fiscal substitution between social security and locally provided education. Unlike in the literature, this type of fiscal design allows local economies to grow faster and more equally than the national design.},

This research is important because it problematizes popular and policy calls to rebalance the economic activity in favour of the ‘real economy’.

The concept of financialisation has emerged within Marxist political economy in an effort to relate booming finance to poorly performing production. Yet, there is no general agreement on what it means, as is shown in this article through a selective review of economic and sociological literature. The article puts forth an analysis of financialization that draws on classical Marxism while remaining mindful of the recent crisis. Financialization represents a systemic transformation of mature capitalist economies with three interrelated features. First, large corporations rely less on banks and have acquired financial capacities; second, banks have shifted their activities toward mediating in open financial markets and transacting with households; third, households have become increasingly involved in the operations of finance. The sources of capitalist profit have also changed accordingly.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a theory of individual behavior in which the drive to accumulate wealth is a critical motive behind economic action. The suggested theory is fully consistent with the neoclassical approach to choice, subject only to displacing the traditional hedonistic interpretation. When this theory of individual behavior is placed in the context of a self-interest private property economy in which individuals accumulate wealth in the form of financial claims (intermediated accumulation) and firms maximize profits, it generates a logical explanation of the causes of effective demand failures.},

  abstract = {The 1993 Finnish tax reform reduced the incentives to use mortgage financing in home acquisition for high-income households. Before the reform, mortgage interest was deductible according to a progressive schedule which meant that the benefit from the deduction was the greater the higher was the taxpayer 's marginal income tax rate. After the reform, the deduction is made according to a flat schedule and the benefit no longer depends on taxpayer 's marginal income tax rate. This setting can be seen as a natural experiment, where one can distinguish multiple treatment groups and a control group. This paper uses household level repeated cross-section data from before and after the reform to study whether Finnish households responded to these changes in incentives to borrow. The results, based on difference-in-differences estimates, show that high income households with high marginal tax rates responded to the reform by clearly reducing their mortgage borrowing compared to the control group which was unaffected by the reform.},

The variables representing economic performance are levels and growth rates of per capita gross domestic product. Using the concept of economic regime, we introduce a notion of distance between the dynamical paths of different countries. Then, a minimal spanning tree and a hierarchical tree are constructed from time series to help detect the existence of groups of countries sharing similar economic performance. The two main clusters that are identified over the whole-time interval can be interpreted as two groups of countries with high and low performance, respectively. The evolution of such clusters shows three main stylised facts: Certain countries move across clusters; the high-performance cluster tends to span, while the low-performance one tends to be (more) compact; and the distance between the two groups increases in time.},

This paper investigates the role of community colleges in shaping the competitiveness of industry clusters. The following analysis presents a case study on the role of the Walla Walla Community College Center for Enology and Viticulture (the Center) cluster-based economic development strategy. The case study examines the ways the Center – which is in Washington State – operates as an intermediary that influences both local labour supply and the social foundations underpinning the production system. Based on case study evidence, it is concluded that the Center's cluster strategy can be understood as a process of ‘institutional thickening’ that enhances the competitiveness and performance of the localized wine industry.

Cet article cherche à examiner le rôle des centres universitaires dans la compétitivité des regroupements industriels. L'analyse présente une étude de cas du rôle de la stratégie du Centre d'oenologie et de viticulture à Walla Walla en faveur du développement économique basé sur la notion de regroupement. L'étude de cas examine la manière dont le Centre – situé dans l'état de Washington – fonctionne en tant qu'un intermédiaire qui influe à la fois sur l'offre d'emploi locale et les fondements sociaux qui étayent le système de production. A partir des preuves provenant de l'étude de cas, on conclut que la stratégie du Centre peut être considérée un processus ‘d’épaississement institutionnel' qui augmente la compétitivité et la performance de l'industrie vinicole locale.

In der folgenden Analyse wird eine Fallstudie über die Rolle des Walla Walla Community College Center für Önologie und Vitikultur (des Zentrums) für eine clusterbasierte Wirtschaftsentwicklungsstrategie vorgestellt. In der Fallstudie wird untersucht, wie das im Staat Washington gelegene Zentrum als Vermittler wirkt und sich sowohl auf das Arbeitskräfteangebot vor Ort als auch auf die gesellschaftlichen Grundlagen des Produktionssystems auswirkt. Anhand der Belege der Fallstudie wird der Schluss gezogen, dass sich die Cluster-Strategie des Zentrums als Prozess der ‘institutionellen Verdichtung’ verstehen lässt, mit dem die Wettbewerbsfähigkeit und Leistung der lokalen Weinindustrie verbessert werden.

En el siguiente análisis se muestra un estudio de caso en cuanto al papel que desempeña el Centro Walla Walla de la Universidad Pública de Enología y Viticultura (el Centro) en la estrategia de desarrollo económico basada en las aglomeraciones. En este estudio de caso examino de qué modo el Centro – situado en el Estado de Washington – funciona como un intermediario que influye tanto en el suministro laboral a nivel local como en las bases sociales que apoyan el sistema de producción. Basándome en el ejemplo de un estudio de caso, llego a la conclusión de que la estrategia de aglomeración del Centro puede entenderse como un proceso de ‘concentración institucional’ que mejora la competitividad y el rendimiento de la industria vinícola localizada.

Low-income participants were interviewed after 18 months (Wave 2) and after program completion at 48 months (Wave 3).

Logistic regression results indicate that among those who were renters at baseline, IDA participation significantly increases the clearing of old debts at Wave 2 and homeownership rates at Wave 3.

  abstract = {This paper argues that Marx’s economics leads us to a deeper understanding of our current crisis than do either mainstream, Keynesian or ‘mainstream Marxist’ economics. First, Marx explains how a tendency for the rate of profit to fall in boom manifests in the generation and speculative investment of ‘surplus’ capital in the financial system/fictitious capital, providing a tendential basis for, rather than an accidental account of, financial bubbles/crises. Secondly, Marx’s understanding that crisis is absolutely necessary to restore the profit rate, and so return the economy to boom, explains why developed countries’ governments’ attempts to postpone or limit crises since the 1970s have merely prevented a decisive enough crisis to restore the profit rate. Persistently low profitability has simply caused the world economy to stagnate, with persistently surplus capital taking many disruptive, adventurous paths. Finally, I consider how Marx’s identification of when lending is ‘lending’, and when it is simply ‘usury’, can help us understand how the nature of the financial system has changed over the last forty years.},

Line of credit growth is shown to be associated with large increases in nonowner-occupied property purchases, suggesting that home equity lines of credit were tapped to fund such investments, exacerbating default rates during the market downturn.},

From 1956 to 1973, Penrose began to focus on large international firms operating in developing countries. She found government to be a continuous input to the growth process. We argue here that Penrose was a heterodox economist, who followed the methodological style and structure of her Austrian mentor Fritz Machlup, embraced the neoclassical case study method of Marshall, and articulated a viewpoint on international growth that is much in line with Roy Harrod, Maurice Byé and Charles Kindleberger, who devoted considerable attention to why governments find it necessary to impose restraints on how such firms invest in their economies. The background and development of Penrose's work has implications for theory and policy, specifically for the Resource-based view which recognizes Penrose as its founder.},

This approach attempts to eliminate the potential correlation present in previous analyses between unobserved individual characteristics leading to homeownership and traits leading to provision of social capital or local amenities. Consistent with previous work, we show that homeownership positively affects political engagement in simple probits. Instrumental variable probits, however, show no impact of homeownership on political involvement. IV results for other social outcomes are less conclusive. The analysis suggests that with the use of an exogenous instrument, it is possible to generate results that are different from the previous literature. Our results also suggest that being eligible to open an IDA did not spur households to provide more social capital or local amenities.},

In particular, interpretations and valuations often differ systematically between mainstream and heterodox contributions. I argue that these differences are best explained through understanding the competing ontological presuppositions of the mainstream and heterodox traditions. If correct, this explanation reinforces the assessment advanced elsewhere (Lawson, 2003) that mainstream and heterodox traditions are best distinguished not according to substantive claims or policy stances but rather precisely in terms of their ontological commitments.},

  abstract = {Since the 1970s, a series of demand and supply related changes have led to significant labour market transformations which have brought about a sustained increase in female employment throughout the world. While similar transformations have also been underway in Turkey, the country appears to be one of the rare exceptions to worldwide trends. During the last two decades both female labour force participation and female employment rates have declined at national level. In this article, two sets of questions are posed to explore the factors likely to influence female labour force participation. One set of questions pertains to the society-specific dynamics of structural change in employment patterns in Turkey, with particular reference to the level and composition of employment in the service sector. A second set of questions is posed to examine labour market relations and the social policy environment in Turkey, and their impact on the demand for and supply of female labour. Current changes in the prevailing policy environment are considered to highlight a certain contradiction in the attitudes of decision makers who seem to be faced with a trade-off between continuing adherence to conservative patriarchal values and the objectives of increasing labour force participation and combating poverty},

It will be given evidence that the policy has widened the wage differentials and the effect is particularly stronger to skilled workers compared with unskilled workers.
