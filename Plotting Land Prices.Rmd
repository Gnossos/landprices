# Introduction  
This notebook documents the construction of a time-series plot of land prices.

# Data  

Three types of data are used for this plot:  

* Land prices
* Recessions
* Consumer Price Index (CPI)  

Each is described below.  

## Land Prices  

The most important data for this plot are from the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy's
["Land and Property Values in the U.S" databases](http://datatoolkits.lincolninst.edu/subcenters/land-values/). The Institute currently hosts four different datasets:  

  1. The ratio of rents to prices for the stock of all owner-occupied housing;  
  2.  Values and price indexes for all land, structures, and housing in residential use;  
  3. Values of homes, structures, and land in residential use, and land and home price indexes for 50 states and the District of Columbia; and  
  4. Values and price indexes for land, structures, and housing for single-family owner-occupied housing units in 46 major U.S. metropolitan areas.  

The present analysis uses the second of these, Aggregate U.S. Land Prices.  

There are three series in this dataset:  

| Series Name |  Property-Price Data Source  | Observation Frequency | Period Covered  |
|:-----------:|:----------------------------:|:---------------------:|:---------------:|
|   CSW       |      Case-Shiller-Weiss      |       Quarterly       | 1975:1 - 2016:1 |
|   FHFA      |Federal Housing Finance Agency|       Quarterly       | 1975:1 - 2016:1 |
| Historical  |    Decennial U.S. Census     |         Annual        |   1930 - 2000   |
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Each file has identically named variables:  

| Variable Name |                           Value Label                |
|:-------------|:------------------------------------------------------|
|     OBS       | Observation date (e.g., 1975Q1)                      |
| LAND_NOM      | Aggregate market value of residential land           |
| MKVAL_NOM     | Aggregate market value of homes                      |
| STRUC_NOM	    | Aggregate replacement cost of residential structures | 
| LAND_PI	      | Price index for residential land                     |
| MKVAL_PI	    | Price index for homes                                |
| STRUC_PI	    | Price index for residential structures               |
| CONS_PI	      | Price index for consumption                          |
------------------------------------------------------------------------


The Institute describes these data as follows:  

>This database contains information on the values and rents of residential properties in the United States, covering four dimensions: the ratio of rents to prices for the stock of all owner-occupied housing; values and price indexes for all land, structures, and housing in the country; values of homes, structures, and land, and land and home price indexes for 50 states and the District of Columbia; and values and price indexes for land, structures, and housing for single-family owner-occupied housing units in 46 major U.S. metropolitan areas. A key feature of this data is separate price indices for land and structures, in addition to the more common price indices for property -- land and structures combined.

## Recessions

## Consumer Price Index (CPI)
