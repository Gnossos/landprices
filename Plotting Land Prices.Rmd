# Introduction  
This notebook documents the construction of a time series plot of land prices.

# Data  

Three types of data are used for this plot:
* Land prices
* Recessions
* Consumer Price Index (CPI)
Each is described below.  

## Land Prices  
The main data for this graph come from the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy's "Land and Property Values in the U.S" database. The Institute describes these data as follows:  

>This database contains information on the values and rents of residential properties in the United States, covering four dimensions: the ratio of rents to prices for the stock of all owner-occupied housing; values and price indexes for all land, structures, and housing in the country; values of homes, structures, and land, and land and home price indexes for 50 states and the District of Columbia; and values and price indexes for land, structures, and housing for single-family owner-occupied housing units in 46 major U.S. metropolitan areas. A key feature of this data is separate price indices for land and structures, in addition to the more common price indices for property -- land and structures combined.

## Recessions

## Consumer Price Index (CPI)
